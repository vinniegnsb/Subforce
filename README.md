# Subforce
A Perforce plugin for Sublime Text 3 that leverages the P4Python API.

## Installation

To install, use Sublime's package manager [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

Alternatively, you can manually clone this repository directly to your Sublime Text 3 Packages directory.

    $ cd path/to/Packages
    $ git clone https://github.com/MrElusive/Subforce.git

Note: you will also need to manually clone the [SublimeP4Python](https://github.com/MrElusive/SublimeP4Python) dependency.

## Setup

Clear the P4CLIENT key to be none from the command line with 

    $ p4 set P4CLIENT= 

Set any necessary keys including P4USER, P4PORT, P4PASSWD, etc. This can either be done globally, with p4 set, or under the plugin settings. If done in plugin settings, the client must be specified as well, which only allows using one client at a time.

## Settings

Refer to [Subforce.sublime-settings](https://github.com/MrElusive/Subforce/blob/master/Subforce.sublime-settings) for a description of the available settings.

Refer to the [Sublime's Settings documentation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/settings.html) and the [unofficial Settings documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/customization/settings.html) for information on how to configure custom settings.
